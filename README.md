# README.md Advent of Code 2025

This repository holds example solutions to the problems in Advent of Code 2025

- [https://adventofcode.com/2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025)

I'm not claiming that they're good or fast or, sometimes, even that they solve the puzzle.

I've changed my repository format this year, as the authors do not want the puzzle text to be reproduced in people's solutions.

All solutions should be able to be run using `python dayNN.py` where `NN` is the day of the puzzle.
